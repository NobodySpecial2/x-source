He was a boy she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk she did ballet
What more can I say he wanted her

She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a sk8er boi, she said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

5 years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on TV guess who she sees
Sk8er boi rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a sk8er boi, she said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a sk8er boi, she said, see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry girl but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends

Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love haven't you heard
How we rock each others world

I'm with the sk8er boi, I said, see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know

I'm with the sk8er boi, I said, see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know

Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you
Like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinnin' with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip
I'm losin' my grip
And I'm in this thing
Alone

Am I just some chick
You placed beside you
To take somebody's place?
When you turn around
Can you recognize my face?
You used to love me
You used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't okay

I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinnin' with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip
I'm losin' my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

Cryin' out loud
I'm cryin' out, loud
Cryin' out loud
I'm cryin' out
Open your eyes
Open up wide

Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why should I care?
If you don't care
Then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere...
Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care
Then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere

Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is

Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You would see

I like you the way you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me, one on one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watching your back like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

You fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into honesty
Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're something else
Where you aren't, where it's at you see
You're making me

Laugh out, when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else

You're trying to be cool

Went back home again
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again

It's time now to turn around
Turn my back on everything
Turn my back on everything

Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm waking up to say I've tried
Instead of waking up to another TV Guide

Its time now, I turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground
Oh, oh, oh

Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changing when I turn around
Out of what I know, everywhere I go, I'm a mobile

I'm a mobile

Hanging from the ceiling, life's a mobile
Spinning 'round with mixed feelings crazy and wild
Sometimes I wanna scream out loud

Everything's changing
Everywhere I go, all out of my control
Everything's changing
Everywhere I go out of what I know, yeah, yeah

Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile

All that I was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face
And I sat up straight

Ooh, yeah, yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me out
Make me go away

(I'm so unwanted)
No, I just don't understand why?
You won't talk to me
It hurts
I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me

Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast just to feel the danger
I wanna scream it makes me feel alive

Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

To walk within the lines would make my life so boring
I want to know that I have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet come on now give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive

Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

Let down your defenses use no common sense
If you look you will see that this world is beautiful
Accident, turbulent, succulent, opulent, permanent, no way
I wanna taste it don't wanna waste it away

Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby

Is it enough? Is it enough? Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

Is it enough?
Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please, oh

I'm tuggin' at my hair
I'm pullin' at my clothes
I'm tryin to keep my cool
I know it shows

I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words
Inside my head

I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you, away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?

If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today, guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

It don't do me any good, it's just a waste of time
What use is it to you, what's on my mind
If it ain't comin' out, we're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you, away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?

If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today, guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

What's wrong with my tongue
These words keep slipping away
I stutter I stumble
Like I've got nothing to say

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

If I could say what I want to say

Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?

Please tell me what is takin' place?
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must have got erased somehow

Probably 'cause I always forget
Every time someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same
(In my world)

Never wore cover-up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a five thousand population town

Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever?
In whose arms, the time and place

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Will someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

I never spend less than an hour
Washin' my hair in the shower
It always takes five hours to make it straight

So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take a friggin' day
There's nothin' else better to do anyway

When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the milky way
On and on it's getting too late out
I'm not in love this time, this night

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Will someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

I take some time, mellow out
Party up and don't fall down
Don't get caught
Sneak out of the house

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Will someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Will someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

Step up step up (step up)
Step up step up (step up)
Step up step up
Step up

Fall back, take a look at me and you'll see
I'm for real, I feel what only I can feel
and if that don't appeal to you
Let me know and I'll go cuz I flow
better when my colors show,
and that's the way it has to be.
Honestly, cuz creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie,
So don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone I've got a backbone stronger than yours.

(step up) la la... (step up) la la... (step up) La la...
Yeah...
If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(Not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(Not nobodys fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try.

Don't know you think you know me like yourself,
But I fear that you're only telling me what I wanna hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand that I can't not be what I am.
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon.
It's not that simple here we go not so soon.
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen
And a little more green,
but it's amazing what a couple of years could mean.

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(Not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(Not nobodys fool) I'm not nobody's fool.

If you wanna bring me down
then go ahead and try
go ahead and try.

Oh...
Go ahead and try
Try to look me in the eye but you'll never see inside
Until you realize (realize)

Things are tryin' to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you I don't need yor doubt in me

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(Not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(Not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
then go ahead and try...

(Go ahead and try) La la... (Go ahead and try) La la...
Yeah... Go ahead and try
You'll be laughing out loud when I'm playin' to my own crowd
Try...

It's the first time I ever felt this lonely
I wish someone could cure this pain
It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Til you chose weed over me, you're so lame

I thought you were cool until the point
But up until the point you didn't call me
When you said, you would
Finally figured out you're all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough, you think, you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

Thought you'd come around when I ignored you
So I thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again

Can't you see that you lie to yourself
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You'd always grow up feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You stand like a stone, alone in your zone
Is it too much that I'm asking for?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't find where I am lying here
Alone I fear, afraid of the dark
No one to claim, alone again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't you see that you lie to yourself
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough, you think you're loveless
It was too much that I'm asking for

Looks like it's just one of those kind of days
You can't kick me down I'm already on the ground
No you can't cause you couldn't catch me anyhow
Blue skies but the sun isn't coming out no
Today it's like I'm under a heavy cloud

And I feel so alive

Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway yeah
I just want to fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway yeah

So So is how I'm doing if you're wondering
I'm in a fight with the world but I'm winning
Stay there come closer it's at your own risk
Yeah you know how it is life can be a bitch

But I feel so alive
I can't help myself, don't you realize

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway yeah
I just want to fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway yeah

Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway yeah

I always needed time on my own

I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone

And the bed where you lie is made up on your side
When you walk away, I count the steps that you take

Do you see how much I need you right now
When you're gone

The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone

The face I came to know is missing too

When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it okay

I miss you
I've never felt this way before

Everything that I do reminds me of you

And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do
When you walk away, I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
And when you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything I do, I'd give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
And when you're gone
The words I need to hear will always get me through the day and make it okay
I miss you

Today was the worst day, I went through hell
I wish I could remove it from my mind
Two months away from you but I couldn't tell
I thought that everything was gonna be just fine

The postcard that you wrote with the stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
Smelled like cheap perfume and it didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
Because you wrote

I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Hey Hey, Psycho Babe
I hate you why are guys so lame
Everything I gave you I want everything back but you

My friends tried to tell me all along
That you weren't the right one for me
My friends tried to tell me to be strong
I bet you didn't think that I would see

The postcard that you wrote with the stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
I wanna see you cry like I did a thousand times
Yeah you're losing me, you're losing me now
Cuz you wrote

Waking up I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant, I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect, please don't go away, I need you now

And I'll hold on to it, don't you let it pass you by
I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

This moment is perfect, please don't go away, I need you now

Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
Off to the next one

You'll be broke and she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Makes you wanna die

I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once
I was wrong, it wasn't keeping me awake.
You didn't listen (you didn't listen)
You didn't hear me (you didn't hear me)
When I said I want more I got no more.
You weren't stealing me away, oh.

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need.
And I, I wish it was.
I think it's time to give this up.

Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
Ohhhh...

All the memory's that we're losing
All the time that I spent with you everyday
I think is running down the drain.
I'm feeling (feeling) that we're fading.
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems, yeah.

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need.
And I, I wish it was.
I think it's time to give this up.

And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly.
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now.
I can see we're burning out so show me, show me.
How you gonna turn it around? Because...

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want.

Remember when I cried
To you a thousand times
I told you everything
You know my feelings
It never crossed my mind
That there would be a time
For us to say goodbye
What a big surprise
But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again

Remember when

I remember when it was together till the end
Now I'm alone again
Where do I begin
I cried a little bit
You died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets
And say you won't forget
But I'm not lost

I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer

It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

That was then

Now it's the end
I'm not coming back
I can't pretend
Remember when
These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around

Don't say no to anything,
yes, yes, say yes to everything,
just find away, to get away (wanna run away?)

Let's take off our clothes, and
see if anybody notices
then run away, what d'you say?
have a little joy have a
little faith, live life
have a little hope have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you, you never know
what fate will throw,
to make you stop,
I, I, I'm gonna try
to let this life
pick me up and take me away

Run up to a stranger,
kiss and tell them that you love them,
and then walk away,
you made their day (at least you hope you did)

Stand up in a restaurant,
start dancing on the table,
get kicked out for that behavior
(oops I did it again)
have a little joy have a
little faith, live life
have a little hope have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you, you never know
what fate will throw,
to make you stop,
I, I, I'm gonna try
to let this life
pick me up and take me away

Don't you know that nothing equals nothing,
do anything, do everything, do something
open up your mouth and let your soul sing

You, you, you never know
what faith will throw,
to make you stop

You, you, you never know what fate will throw,
to make you stop
I'm gonna try,
to let this life,
pick me up and take me away

Something just isn't right
I can feel it inside
The truth isn't far behind me
You can't deny
When I turn the lights out
When I close my eyes
Reality overcomes me
I'm living a lie

When I'm alone
I feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel...
Together
It doesn't feel right at all
Together
Together we've built a wall
Together
Holding hands we'll fall

Hands we'll fall
This has gone on so long

Something good to rely on

Something for me
When I'm alone
I feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel...
Together
It doesn't feel right at all
Together
Together we've built a wall
Together

Holding hands we'll fall
Hands we'll fall

There's not much going on today
I'm really bored, it's getting late
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate

Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

This is when I start to bite my nails
And clean my room when all else fails
I think it's time for me to bail

Yeah, yeah, yeah

How do you always have an opinion?
And how do you always find
The best way to compromise?
We don't need to have a reason
We don't need anything
We're just wasting time

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Find yourself
'Cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?
Find yourself
'Cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day

So you go make it happen
Do your best
Just keep on laughing
I'm telling you
There's always a brand new day
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

I looked away
Then I look back at you
You try to say
The things that you can't undo
If I had my way
I'd never get over you
Today's the day
I pray that we make it through

Make it through the fall
Make it through it all

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love With you

You're the only one,
I'd be with till the end
When I come undone
You bring me back again
Back under the stars
Back into your arms

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love With you

Wanna know who you are
Wanna know where to start
I wanna know what this means

Wanna know how you feel
Wanna know what is real
I wanna know everything, everything

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love With you

I'm in love with you
Cuz i'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

Try to tell me what I shouldn't do
You should know by now
I won't listen to you
Walk around with my hands up in the air
Cause I don't care

Cause I'm alright, I'm fine
Just freak out, let it go

I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Just freak out, let it go

You don't always have to do everything right
Stand up for yourself
And put up a fight
walk around with your hands up in the air
Like you don't care

Cause I'm alright, I'm fine
Just freak out, let it go

I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go

(On my own)
Let it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Just let me live my life...

I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Gonna freak out, let it go
Gonna freak out, let it go.

Every now and then we all want somethin'
Even if there's no way of gettin' it.
If I stomp my feet quick that maybe be the way around it
Could I get myself around it.

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
So give me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot

Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say well that's just life
I'll drown you out when I open my mouth
And make my way around it.

I always make my way around it.
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
Give me what I want

Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want.
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what I want

It's not what you want.
I'm not about to take no
For answer; NO, if I tell
You I can't I'm still gonna go.
I did it all by myself and I found

I found my way around it
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
Give me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what i want

That's not what you want.
It's not too lovely
It could start to get ugly

It really bugs me, if
If I don't get my way!
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
So give me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want.
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what I want
It's not what you want.
If I don't get what I want
It's not what you want.
